Introduction
============

Shelr.tv is a service and a tool for terminal screencasting. This charm will deploy
the latest Shelr.tv code to provide the web interface found on http://shelr.tv/

Deployment
==========

    juju deploy mongodb
    juju deploy shelr.tv
    juju add-relation shelr.tv mongodb
    juju expose shelr.tv

Configuration
=============

Shelr.tv has several additional options for configuration. These are all optional as
the primary charm will deploy and run without issues; however, if you want to enable
different log-in provdiers or configure an "admin" see the following options. At any
time you can run `juju get shelr.tv` to investigate all available options for your
deployment.

google-id: 
google-secret:
  The Google Application ID and Secret which can be obtained by registering your app
  on Google.

github-id:
github-secret:
  The Github Application ID and Secret which can be obtained by registering at 
  the following URL: https://github.com/settings/applications/new

twitter-id:
twitter-secret:
  The Twitter Application ID and Secret which can be obtained by registering at
  the following URL: https://dev.twitter.com/apps/new

god:
  This will apply "god" access to the supplied User ID, The user ID can be derived
  from the User profile URL, eg: http://shelr.tv/users/4f809ab19660802ca6000001 in
  this example 4f809ab19660802ca6000001 would be the user's ID and would be supplied
  as the VALUE for this option


To set one or more of these configuration options run the following command

    juju set shelr.tv OPTION=VALUE [OPTION=VALUE ...]

Where OPTION is one of the aforementioned configuration options, and VALUE is the
value you wish to set for that option. You can set as many options as you'd like
in a single command by continuing to set additional values. An example below:

    juju set shelr.tv google-id=YourGoogleApplicationID google-secret=YourSecretKey god=8675309

Future
======

The author reports that pure OpenID support will be added soon, which will negate
the need to use github, twitter, and google settings for login.

Troubleshooting
===============

 - Browser says: Can not connect to server
    Make sure you've executed `juju expose shelr.tv`

 - Browser still says: Can not connect to server
    It can sometimes take several minutes for the WEBrick Ruby Server to start for the
    first time, if you've recently performed the add-relation command, waiting up to
    five minutes before reporting a bug is recommended.
 - Local shelr won't publish to my new site
    The shelr client was just recently updated to allow for multiple shelr.tv instances
    as such, run `gem upgrade` to pull the latest version down. Once updated get the API
    key for your user from the deployed Juju instance and the public-address for the 
    instance and run the following command:
    
        shelr setup [API_KEY] [PUBLIC-ADDRESS]
    
    This will setup shelr to push all recordings to your new instance. At this time there
    is no way to switch hosts on the fly during pushing.
